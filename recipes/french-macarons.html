        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>3 extra-large egg whites</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 2/3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2/3 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). 
                Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl 
                with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy, 
                about 30 seconds. Add white sugar and continue to 
                beat until peaks are stiff enough they stay in 
                place when the bowl is turned upside down, about 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Sift 1 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, almond flour, 
                and salt together twice. Fold into the egg whites 
                until batter is creamy and falls slowly off the 
                lifted spatula, about 50 turns with a spatula. 
                Transfer batter to a piping bag fitted with a 
                round tip.</li>
            <li>Pipe batter onto the parchment paper, using a 
                circular motion to make macarons 1 inch in 
                diameter. Tap the baking sheet against the 
                counter about 10 times to release any air 
                bubbles.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 minutes. 
                    Rotate baking sheet and continue baking until 
                    macarons are shiny and rise slightly to form 
                    "feet", about 9 minutes more. Peel off the 
                    parchment paper and allow to cool completely, 
                    about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Beat butter, 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, 
                    and vanilla extract with an electric mixer 
                    until creamy and thick, about 10 minutes. 
                    Transfer filling to a piping bag fitted with 
                    a round tip.</li>
                <li>Pipe a small amount of filling onto the 
                    center of 1 macaron; top with another 
                    macaron and press gently to sandwich the 
                    filling between the two.</li>
        </ol>
